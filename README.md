- **First assignment**: Implementing linear regression
- **Second assignment**: Implementing logistic regression
- **Third assignment**: Implementing classification of digits using one vs all logistic regression method and an already trained 
neural network in the second part
- **Forth assignment**: Implementing classification of digits by training a simple neural network
- **Fifth assignment**: Regularized linear regression and bias/variance. Seeing how the number of training examples and 
choice of regulariztion parameter affect the training and validation error.
