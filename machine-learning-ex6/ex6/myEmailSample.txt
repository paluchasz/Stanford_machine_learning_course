Hello everyone,
 
On the last Wednesday before the Chess Club closes for Christmas we normally have some light-hearted chess at Antioch House accompanied by mince pies and mulled wine. This year it has been suggested instead that next Wednesday we should go out for an Indian meal, before perhaps moving on to The Woodman for some blitz chess. If this new idea appeals to you, please let me know as soon as possible.
 
There are several Indian restaurants in Durham. Mike Ayton, who I regard as a connoisseur in these matters, reckons that the Alishaan at the top of North Road is the best!
 
Best regards,
